<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Taipeng Liu, a young programmer and the developer of <u><a href="https://www.taipengliu.com">Taipeng's Homepage</a></u>.</p>

<p>Before talking about the motivation of building up this site, I want to briefly introduce myself. I got bachelor's degree of Civil Engineering from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://en.tongji.edu.cn" target="_blank"><u>Tongji University </u></a>at 2018. In undergraduate, I had little experience with Computer Science. Although I took one or two courses about programming and "learned" (well, I would say played trick with) C++, C# and Java, at most I only knew simple data structure (int, bool), basic flow control (while-loop, if-else, for-loop), and naive sorting algorithms (bubble sort). Oh, I might also have some ideas of what a SQL command looks like. In one word, what I learned in undergraduate is very easy coding, but I was having fun with it.</p>

<p>I got master's degree of Civil Engineering at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://illinois.edu" target="_blank"><u>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</u></a> at 2020. During two-year graduate learning, I really grew up from a beginner with nearly no programming background to a "young" programmer. I emphasize on the adjective "young" because I am somehow between a beginner and a sophisticated programmer. </p>

<p>Therefore, the motivation to build the site is to witness my growth towards a computer scientist. My dream is becoming a computer scientist who has thorough understandings of how computer systems and networking work, and also has a unique perspective on design of systems with large topology, greatly distributed, and high availability. As a young programmer, I am still far away from my dream, so I need to be very hard-working. </p>

<p>The goal of this site is to make contribution to the large community of computer science by sharing with you the posts about learning skills in that field. In the past, I have learned three important lessons: (a) keep building things step by step; (b) learn from review and summary of past works; and (c) teaching and sharing is the best way to demonstrate people's understandings. I will keep writing posts to share with people what I have learned about computer science, including but not limited to basic theories and concepts, useful tools and techniques, and personal projects. </p>
